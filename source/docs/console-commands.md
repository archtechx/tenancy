# Console Commands {#console-commands}

The package comes with some artisan commands that will help you during development.

## Migrate {#migrate}

The most important command. To use tenants, you have to be able to migrate their databases.

You can use the `tenants:migrate` command to migrate tenant's databases. You can also specify which tenants' databases should be migrated using the `--tenants` option.
```
php artisan tenants:migrate --tenants=8075a580-1cb8-11e9-8822-49c5d8f8ff23
```

> Note: Tenant migrations must be located in `database/migrations/tenant`.

You can use these commands outside the command line as well. If you want to migrate a tenant's database in a controller, you can use the `Artisan` facade.
```php
$tenant = tenant()->create('tenant1.localhost');

\Artisan::call('tenants:migrate', [
    '--tenants' => [$tenant['uuid']]
]);
```

## Rollback & seed {#rollback}

- Rollback: `tenants:rollback`
- Seed: `tenants:seed`

Similarly to [migrate](#migrate), these commands accept a `--tenants` option.

## Run {#run}

You can use the tenants:run command to run your own commands for tenants.

If your command's signature were `email:send {--queue} {--subject=} {body}`, you would run this command like this:
```
php artisan tenants:run email:send --tenants=8075a580-1cb8-11e9-8822-49c5d8f8ff23 --option="queue=1" --option="subject=New Feature" --argument="body=We have launched a new feature. ..."
```

## Tenant list {#tenant-list}

```none
php artisan tenants:list
Listing all tenants.
[Tenant] uuid: dbe0b330-1a6e-11e9-b4c3-354da4b4f339 @ localhost
[Tenant] uuid: 49670df0-1a87-11e9-b7ba-cf5353777957 @ dev.localhost
```

## Selectively clearing tenant cache {#selectively-clearing-tenant-cache}

You can delete specific tenants' cache by using the `--tags` option on `cache:clear`:
```
php artisan cache:clear --tags=tenantdbe0b330-1a6e-11e9-b4c3-354da4b4f339
```

The tag is `config('tenancy.cache.tag_base') . $uuid`.
