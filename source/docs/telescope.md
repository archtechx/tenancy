# Telescope Integration

Requests in Telescope are automatically tagged with the tenant uuid and domain:

This lets you filter requests by uuid and domain:

If you'd like to set Telescope tags in your own code, e.g. in your `AppServiceProvider`, replace your `Telescope::tag()` call like this:
```php
\Tenancy::integrationEvent('telescope', function ($entry) {
    return ['abc']; // your logic
});
```

Once Telescope 3 is released, you won't have to do this.

To have Telescope working, make sure your `telescope.storage.database.connection` points to a non-tenant connection. It's that way by default, so for most projects, Telescope should work out of the box.
